# Voiceboard

Whiteboarding and diagramming is a critical component to sharing and conveying ideas, especially in an educational setting. However, not everyone has the ability to draw or write legibly, or even write at all. Voiceboard is a web application that allows users to articulate and visualize their thoughts with speech recognition to diagramming technology. Users can speak their ideas and have them translated into text, which can then be converted into diagrams and flowcharts. This application is designed to be accessible to all users, regardless of their ability to write or draw, and make it easier for all people to share their ideas equally.
